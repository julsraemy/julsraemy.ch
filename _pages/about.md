## [First, a little bit about me]

My name is [Julien Antoine Raemy][name] and I come from Fribourg, Switzerland. I am a bookseller by trade and I used to work for a book distributor and in a bookshop. After receiving my Certificate of Vocational Education and Training of Bookseller in August 2008 (or in French: _Certificat fédéral de capacité de libraire_), I decided to brush up on my English and I did a six-month internship in the [ELT Marketing Department of Oxford University Press][elt] in the UK. I would have loved to stay a bit longer but I had to go back to Switzerland in order to fulfill the mandatory military service period, which I did in one go in ten months.

Then, I worked here and there before I decided that it was time to travel again in Australia (also, I still needed to improve my English skills). I went to Syndey and studied there for about seven months between September 2011 and April 2012. It was all great but I didn’t really know what to do. I thought it would be a good idea to become an English Teacher for some time in Poland so I undertook an intensive four-week course in July 2012 to obtain a [Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA)][celta]. Once more, it was a great experience to live and work in Warsaw for almost ten months. Nevertheless, I decided to go back to Switzerland to seek meaningfulness. But what shall I do?

## [Then, the more interesting stuff about what I do now]

Between September 2013 and July 2017, I undertook on a part-time basis a Bachelor in Library and Information Science (LIS) at the HES-SO University of Applied Sciences and Arts, [Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE)][heg] in Geneva, Switzerland. Between January 2015 and the end of my bachelor's degree, I was also  working for the [EPFL’s MetaMedia Center][metamedia] as a Photo Archivist for the Montreux Jazz Digital Project. I really enjoyed to work and study at the same time.

Between August 2017 and January 2021, I was working as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the HEG-GE for the Professor René Schneider and besides working on his [research projects][bilingue_id_projets], I helped him to coordinate the bilingual curriculum in LIS (French/German). During that I also carried out a [Master's degree in Information Science][master-is] on a part-time basis so that I can keep working alongside my studies.

Starting July 2020 and in parallel to my assistantship in Geneva, I started working as a Knowledge Graph Engineer and IIIF Systems Architect for the [Swiss Art Research Infrastructure][sari] (SARI) hosted at the University of Zurich and operated in cooperation with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) and the Swiss Institute for Art Research (SIK-ISEA). I was committed to working there for a longer period of time but finally I stayed there for six months until the end of 2020 as I received an opportunity to pursue a funded PhD at the University of Basel.  

Since February 2021, I have embarked on a PhD in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel, [Digital Humanities Lab][dhlab] in the context of the multidisciplinary project funded by the SNSF titled "Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archive" (PIA). Simultaneously, I have also started working on a contract basis as an Interoperability and Metadata Consultant at the [Swiss National Data & Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH)][dasch].
