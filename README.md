This website is about my work, views and expectations on information retrieval, semantic web technologies, user-centred design, the [International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)](https://iiif.io/), digitisation, digital humanities, digital preservation, open science, research data management, and all sorts of things related to digital data curation in the cultural heritage field. From time to time, I think this website will also be dedicated to personal matters, music, and literature
