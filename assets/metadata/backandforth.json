These limitations can be translated into what Susan Leigh Star defines as residual categories and consequently the generation of boundary objects. The question of these non-standardised residuals within the cultural heritage and digital humanities fields is an iterative identification issue that institutions and individuals have sought to mitigate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Take for instance resources conforming to the application programming interfaces (APIs) of the <a href=\"https://iiif.io\">International Image Interoperability Framework</a> (IIIF). These are JSON-LD serialised objects duly specified and vetted by a community trying to break institutional silos. Of particular interest are resources compliant with the <a href=\"https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/\">IIIF Presentation API</a> which underpins what a <strong>Manifest</strong> is, i.e.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>a&nbsp;description of the structure and properties of the compound object&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which can be interpreted by a client and displayed to end-users, typically disseminated openly on the Web.</p>\n\n<p>While on the surface or theoretically these IIIF Manifests, or&nbsp;<em>compound objects</em>, could be quite the antithesis of boundary objects, it remains to be seen to what extent IIIF-compatible resources revolve around residual categories and also from what point onward these Manifests have been at some point or revert to boundary objects, whether they are not well-structured or simply because the architecture and constituent software serving and interpreting them (known as viewers in the IIIF ecosystem) do not operate correctly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional resources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Presentation made on Exhibit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exhibit.so/exhibits/cXc5lm2e0G10tDVywh9b\">https://www.exhibit.so/exhibits/cXc5lm2e0G10tDVywh9b</a></li>\n\t<li>Verbose script as a blog post: <a href=\"https://julsraemy.ch/posts/2022/10/05/boundary-objects-iiif-dariah/\">https://julsraemy.ch/posts/2022/10/05/boundary-objects-iiif-dariah/</a></li>\n\t<li>IIIF Manifest:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://julsraemy.ch/hostiiing/manifests/backandforth.json\">https://julsraemy.ch/hostiiing/manifests/backandforth.json</a></li>\n</ul>",
