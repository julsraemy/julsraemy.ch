On the 13th of December 2016, I delivered a presentation at the Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE) about the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) during a seminar on Web and Information and Communications Technology (ICT). I decided to take this subject because I took part in the [IIIF Working Groups Meeting in the Hague][IIIF-Hague] last October and I have been since hooked by what this community is up to.

This is a journal club kind of presentation where I had to review a paper. The IIIF community hasn’t yet publish a lot of papers, and I decided to go for a conference one by Stuart Snydman, Robert Sanderson and Tom Cramer, all of them working at the University of Stanford when it was published (see below the video to get the full reference).

As it isn’t a long paper and because we had to stand in front of the class for 45 minutes, it gave me a lot of time to really talk about IIIF and explain their [APIs][IIIF-APIs] to my fellow students and to the professor, as well as showcasing a couple of interesting and mind-blowing features (I think about the ability to drag and drop IIIF manifests into [Mirador][Mirador] or the [Universal Viewer][UV] for example).
