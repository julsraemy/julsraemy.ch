On the 12th of March, [BIS][bis] and [SAB/CLP][clp], two Swiss Library Associations decided to merge into a new entity called "Bibliosuisse". The former being the association which mostly represents academic and heritage libraries as well as documentation centres (_BIS = Bibliothèque Information Suisse_) and the latter reading public libraries (_CLP = Communauté de travail des bibliothèques suisses de lecture publique_).

The merge will officially happen on August 29th in Montreux during the [Swiss Library Congress][montreux] and the new association will start its activity on 1 January 2019. Bibliosuisse will defend the interests of all types of libraries and their staff.
