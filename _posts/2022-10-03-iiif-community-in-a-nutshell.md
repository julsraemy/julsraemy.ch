## Overview of the IIIF Community

The [International Image Interoperablity Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF) is a community-driven effort which is sometimes rather confusing to grasp quickly given the number of different committees, groups and denominations involved. I have tried to provide an overview of the different actors showing the relationships and sometimes the deliverables. I hope this diagram will help anyone to better appreciate who is involved within this community, led by [a consortium](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/) (IIIF-C).
