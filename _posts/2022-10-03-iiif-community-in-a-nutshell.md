## Overview of the IIIF Community

The [International Image Interoperablity Framework](https://iiif.io) (IIIF) is a community-driven effort which is sometimes rather confusing to grasp quickly given the number of different committees, groups and denominations involved.

I have tried to provide an overview of the different actors showing the relationships and sometimes the deliverables. I hope this diagram (click [here][iiif_community_overview] to see a bigger version in SVG) will help anyone to better appreciate who is involved within this community, led by [a consortium](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/) (IIIF-C).

These different entities are composed of individuals, mainly from institutions who have implemented IIIF and/or are part of IIIF-C, the [community map](https://iiif.io/community/map/) is a good resource to look at. If you don't see a dot on the map and you are involved in the community, please let the [IIIF-C staff members](https://iiif.io/community/consortium/staff/) know and they will add it.
